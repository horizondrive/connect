## ðŸ’¡ How Does Horizon Connect Work? ðŸ’¡
Horizon Connect seamlessly integrates various Cloudflare services to provide a powerful user experience:

### Services at the Core
 - **Frontend with Cloudflare Pages**: Our frontend interface is built with Cloudflare Pages, ensuring a responsive and visually engaging user experience.
 - **Backend powered by Cloudflare Functions**: The backend operations are orchestrated using Cloudflare Functions, enabling efficient data processing and seamless user interactions.
 - **SQL Database with Cloudflare D1**: To manage structured data securely and efficiently, we rely on Cloudflare D1 for our SQL database, ensuring reliability and scalability.

### Why Cloudflare?
We've chosen Cloudflare as our hosting partner for several compelling reasons:
 - **Global Network Reach**: Cloudflare's extensive global network spans over 300 cities in more than 100 counties, ensuring that our services are accessible to users worldwide. This global presence provides low-latency access and high reliability.
 - **Edge Network Advantages**: Leveraging Cloudflare's edge computing capabilities, we can process user requests at data centers closest to their geographical location. This optimization reduces latency and enhances overall performance, delivering a seamless experience.
 - **Cost-Effective solutions**: Cloudflare offers competitive pricing, allowing us to provide accessible services without compromising quality or affordabilitiy. We strive to offer a service that remains cost-effective for both our users and our project.
 - **Data Privacy Assurance**: Your data privacy is paramount to us. Cloudflare's strict policy against selling personal data aligns perfectly with our commitment to user trust and confidentiality. Your information remains protected, and your privacy is our priority.

### Flaws of Using Cloudflare
While we value the advantages of Cloudflare, it's important to be aware of potential limitations:
 - **Single Network Dependency**: Relying solely on one network could pose a risk in the event of network-related issues or outages. We could continuously monitor and mitigate this potential risk to ensure service reliability.
 - **Function Body Size Limitations**: Cloudflare Functions impose a body size limit of 100MB. For users uploading large files (e.g., 5GB), this might result in multiple uploads, potentially incurring additional costs. We are actively exploring solutions to optimize this process and minimize any inconveniences.

Horizon Connect harnesses the power of Cloudflare's services while acknowledging porential limitations, striving to provide a seamless and secure platform for managing your Horizon Drive account. We are committed to addressing challenges and enchancing the user experience to provide you with the best possible service.
